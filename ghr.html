<p>In fairness to the Honorable Judge, it’s not clear what I should have expected her to imagine when I said “global health”. Everyone understands medicine, and most folks probably have a good sense of what we mean by public health. But global health?</p>

<p>Maybe I would have made the cut had had I said, “<strong>global health is the study and practice of improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide</strong>”. This is how <span class="citation">Koplan et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-koplan:2009">2009</a>)</span> defined global health in a <em>Lancet</em> article published a few months after my court appearance. They also offered this longer version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Global health</strong> emphasises transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration; and is a synthesis of population-based prevention with individual-level clinical care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">“Determinants” of health/illness is one of those terms that you’ll come across a lot in global health. It refers to the things that contribute to our health and wellbeing. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/zvdxezv">Pretty much everything</a>. Ironically, despite sounding so <em>deterministic</em>, the study of determinants is mostly <em>probabilistic</em>. A social determinant like poverty is generally associated with worse health outcomes, but not everyone living in poverty has the same experience.</span></span></p>
<p>This definition reflects the reality that the determinants of ill health and inequality are complex, so the search for solutions must span multiple disciplines. In the study of malaria, for example, you can read about the spread of the disease (epidemiology), the impact of illness on future productivity (economics), the merits of free or subsidized bed nets (public policy), mosquito habitats (ecology), the efficacy of vaccines to prevent the disease (medicine and statistics), rapid diagnostic tests (biomedical engineering), and the adoption and use of bed nets (psychology), just to name a few areas of inquiry.</p>
<p>Therefore, we say that global health research is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. It is <strong>multidisciplinary</strong> in the sense that no one field can solve the great global health challenges of our time, and <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> because collaboration is core to progress <span class="citation">(Merson, Black, and Mills <a href="references.html#ref-merson:2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What Makes Research Scientific?</h2>
<p>We conduct research all the time. Your internet browser history probably has many good examples. Mine does. When was the term “AIDS” first used? How widespread is male circumcision today? Do bees poop? (I have a curious 4 year old.) But my research into the answers to these questions is not an example of scientific research.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>Common Rule</strong>, a US federal policy that governs research with human subjects, <strong>research</strong> is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to <em>generalizable knowledge (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=83cd09e1c0f5c6937cd9d7513160fc3f&amp;pitd=20180719&amp;n=pt45.1.46&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML">Title 45, Subtitle A, Subchapter A, Part 46.102</a>)</em></p>

<p><label for="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Global health largely focuses on applied research questions. What are risk factors for a certain disorder? Does this new treatment improve health? Unlike research questions in the natural sciences, the answers to most global health research questions are probabilistic. Uncertain. What goes up might come down, for some people.</span></span></p>
<p>There are three main characteristics of scientific research that apply to most of global health <span class="citation">(King, Keohane, and Verba <a href="references.html#ref-king:1994">1994</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The conclusions are uncertain.</li>
</ol>
<div id="all-about-inference" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> ALL ABOUT INFERENCE</h3>
<p>By stating that the goal of scientific research is inference, we mean that science goes beyond the collection of facts. <strong>Inference</strong> refers to the process of making conclusions about some unobserved or unmeasured phenomenon based on direct observations of the world. What is known is used to infer something about things that are not known. This process can be deductive or inductive.</p>
<p>In <strong>deductive</strong> reasoning, we start from general theories and make hypotheses. Then we collect data and make conclusions based on the data. <strong>Inductive</strong> reasoning flows the other direction, from specific observations to the generation of hypotheses and theories. To say that quantitative research is deductive and qualitative research is inductive is not quite right, but it’s often true.</p>
<p>The point to take away about inference is that, regardless of the approach to reasoning, the goal of scientific research is to use what we observe to make conclusions about what we do not or cannot observe directly. This is sometimes referred to as <strong>empiricism</strong>, and our systematic observations are <strong>empirical evidence</strong>. Empiricism is at the heart of scientific research.</p>

</p>
<p>Scientific research uses public methods that can be examined and replicated. A Method section in a scientific paper is like a recipe. If you have ever tried to follow a confusing recipe, you can appreciate the importance of good documentation. Your study’s recipe must be clear (well written), thorough (no “dash” of this or that), and shared publicly (not a secret passed down to lab members).</p>
<p><strong>Replication</strong> is a core principle of scientific research. No one study rules the day. If the results of a study are robust, another research group should be able to follow your recipe and replicate the findings. When such findings are replicated, we all have more confidence in the results.</p>
<p>In later chapters we’ll learn strategies for writing a good Method section (and appendices!) and discuss why replications are actually rare in practice—and why they can be so controversial.</p>

<div id="living-with-uncertainty" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> LIVING WITH UNCERTAINTY</h3>
<p>Every method has limitations, every measurement has error, and every model is wrong to some extent. Take the estimation of maternal mortality rates as an example. <span class="citation">Hogan et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-hogan:2010">2010</a>)</span> published maternal mortality estimates for 181 countries. Some countries, such as the United States, have vast amounts of data in vital registries that attempt to track all births and deaths. It’s not perfect, so we still estimate the maternal mortality rate using a statistical model (we’ll discuss models more in a later chapter).</p>
<p>As you can see in the left panel of Figure <a href="ghr.html#fig:mmr">1.2</a>, the United States has a very low level of maternal mortality, between about 10-20 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live child births. Compared to some countries, the US has a lot of data points for estimating the level and trend in maternal deaths, so the “uncertainty band” is narrow.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth">
<span id="fig:mmr"></span>
<img src="GHR_files/figure-html/mmr-1.png" alt="Estimates of the maternal mortality rate in the United States and Afghanistan, [@hogan:2010]. Visualized by Yours Truly based on values extracted from published plots." width="1152"><p class="caption marginnote shownote">

</p>
</div>
<p>Now take a look at Afghanistan on the right. Note that the y-axis scale is much larger in the 1000s, reflecting the fact that many more Afghan women die of causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. Next, pay attention to the width of the uncertainty band. It spans a range of more than 3000 deaths. Compare this to a range of fewer than 5 deaths in the US! This is because there are very few data points available to estimate the “true” value in Afghanistan, and these individual data points can differ by more than 1000 deaths. We don’t know much about maternal mortality in Afghanistan, but the blue line is our best guess.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-9" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Your <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Spidey-sense">spidy sense</a> should tingle a bit when you read an article that ignores or hides uncertainty.</span></span></p>
<p>The takeaway message is that there is uncertainty in everything. No single estimate can be considered “The Truth.” Instead, we must focus on the origin of estimates and recognize the limitations of what we know or what is being reported.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> What Constitutes Global Health Research?</h2>
<p>Global health research brings together scholars and practitioners from many different disciplines to tackle big challenges. Therefore, the methods of these disciplines <em>are</em> the methods of global health research. We can organize the landscape as shown in Figure <a href="ghr.html#fig:basicapplied">1.3</a>.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth">
<span id="fig:basicapplied"></span>
<img src="images/basicapplied.png" alt="A research taxonomy"><p class="caption marginnote shownote">
Figure 1.3: A research taxonomy
</p>
</div>
<p>Research is divided into two main categories: basic and applied. Overlapping with applied research is an area of work called “monitoring and evaluation”, or M&amp;E. Let’s examine what constitutes research before turning to M&amp;E.</p>
<div id="basic-research" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> BASIC RESEARCH</h3>
<p><strong>Basic research</strong>—also known as “pure” or “blue skies” research—is the pursuit of fundamental knowledge of phenomena. For example, scientists conduct laboratory experiments to understand the parasitic life cycle and how parasites interact with humans at different stages. Another example is the scientific investigation of the properties of cancer cells to better understand how they grow and spread.</p>
<p>The information generated by basic science becomes the basis for applied science. It’s the “bench” in the “bench to bedside” cascade of research needed to take an idea from the lab (<em>the bench</em>) to a new medical treatment (<em>delivered to the patient’s bedside</em>).</p>
<p>Harvard Medical School’s Rachel Wilson explains this beautifully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new therapies of today were the prototypes of yesterday. And the prototypes of yesterday were previously just findings in laboratories, and before that they were just an idea. Unless we have new ideas, we’re not going to have useful therapies. Great new therapies don’t just fall like apples from a tree.</p>

</div>
<div id="applied-research" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> APPLIED RESEARCH</h3>
<p><strong>Applied research</strong> focuses on specific problems or real-world applications. Whereas the basic scientist might toil away in the lab to understand how cellular enzymes function without a specific clinical application in mind—discovering this function is the end goal for this scientist—the applied researcher will take this knowledge of enzymes to develop new therapies that could treat cancer.</p>
<p>In the world of malaria research, an applied research question might be, “How can we increase the coverage and use of bed nets that prevent malaria transmission?” The basic science, such as the behavioral habits of the mosquito and the transmission conditions for malaria, have already been characterized by entomologists and epidemiologists.</p>
<div id="clinical-research" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Clinical Research</h4>
<p>Applied science takes many different forms, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_research"><strong>clinical research</strong></a>. Clinical research is a broad field that encompasses patient-oriented research, epidemiological and behavioral studies, outcomes research, and health services research. Basic research provides the foundation for all clinical research.</p>

These types of deviations are common in research. The goals of these particular trials demanded larger sample sizes than is typical.</span></span></p>
<p>Clinical research on humans began in 1992. To obtain regulatory approval, the vaccine had to complete three phases of testing. Doherty et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-doherty:1999">1999</a>)</span> conducted a <strong>Phase I</strong> safety and immunogenicity trial with 20 adults in The Gambia in 1997. This small sample size is typical of Phase I trials, where the main objectives are usually to determine a safe dosing range and to evaluate side effects. These researchers reported that the vaccine did not have any significant toxicity but did produce the expected antibodies.</p>
<p>Several <strong>Phase II</strong> studies conducted over the following decade (Phase IIa and Phase IIb) demonstrated the <strong>efficacy</strong> of the vaccine against several end points (or outcomes) <span class="citation">(Moorthy and Ballou <a href="references.html#ref-moorthy:2009">2009</a>)</span>. A Phase IIb trial began in Mozambique in 2003 with more than 2,000 children aged 1 to 4 years <span class="citation">(Alonso et al. <a href="references.html#ref-alonso:2004">2004</a>)</span>. Each child was randomly assigned to receive 3 doses of RTS,S or a control vaccine. After 6 months, the prevalence of malaria was 37% lower in the treatment group than in the control group. A follow-up study with 214 infants also showed partial protection from malaria <span class="citation">(Aponte et al. <a href="references.html#ref-aponte:2007">2007</a>)</span>. This Phase II trial was an important proof-of-concept study.</p>
<p>The final results of a large <strong>Phase III</strong> trial with more than 15,000 infants and young children in 7 African countries were published in <em>The Lancet</em> in 2015 <span class="citation">(RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership <a href="references.html#ref-rts:2015">2015</a>)</span>. Children who participated in the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms: (a) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose at month 20, (b) 3 doses of RTS,S and a booster dose of a comparator vaccine at month 20, or (c) 4 doses of a comparator vaccine. RTS,S reduced clinical malaria cases by 28% and 18% among young children and infants, respectively, over a 3–4-year period. This Phase III trial achieved its goal—to show that the treatment was efficacious.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results, the European Medicines Agency issued a “European scientific opinion” to help inform the decision of the WHO and African national regulatory authorities regarding their recommendation of the vaccine. If RTS,S is approved for use and eventually hits the market, researchers will likely conduct <strong>Phase IV</strong> trials to evaluate the vaccine’s long-term effects.</p>

<p>The research on RTS,S, will not end there, however. The vaccine may be efficacious, but that does not mean it will be easy or cost-effective to produce and deliver at a scale of millions.

<li>T2: Translation from early clinical trials to Phase III trials and beyond with larger patient populations</li>

<p>Another arena of applied work in global health is <strong>monitoring and evaluation</strong>, or M&amp;E.</p>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Evaluation</h4>
<p>In the United States, program evaluation became commonplace by the end of the 1950s and grew dramatically in the 1960s as the federal government expanded and introduced new social programs. Lawmakers wanted accountability, and the evaluation of social programs took off <span class="citation">(Rossi, Lipsey, and Freeman <a href="references.html#ref-rossi:2003">2003</a>)</span>. <strong><em>But is program evaluation really research?</em></strong></p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-16" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Campbell had an outsized impact on the field. It is no surprise that an organization dedicated to synthesizing the best available evidence on social interventions, the <a href="http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/">Campbell Collaboration</a>, bears his name.</span></span></p>
<p>Methods giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_T._Campbell">Donald Campbell</a> thought so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States and other modern nations should be ready for an experimental approach to social reform, an approach in which we try out new programs designed to cure specific problems, in which we learn whether or not these programs are effective, and in which we retain, imitate, modify or discard them on the basis of their effectiveness on the multiple imperfect criteria available <span class="citation">(Campbell <a href="references.html#ref-campbell:1969">1969</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not everyone agrees. Some have argued that program evaluation is really designed for program implementers and funders, and that the messy nature of program implementation requires a loosening of research standards <span class="citation">(Cronbach <a href="references.html#ref-cronbach:1982">1982</a>)</span>. We should simply evaluate the evidence, or “learn what we can.”</p>
<p>In their introductory text on evaluation, Rossi et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rossi:2003">2003</a>)</span> strike a balance in views on this question of whether program evaluation is research. Their answer is perhaps a bit unsatisfying but is arguably true nevertheless: <em>It depends</em>.</p>
<p>Program evaluations should be as rigorous as logistics, ethics, politics, and resources permit—and no less. Surely a lower bound in terms of quality or what is worthwhile exists, but the line is so context dependent that a simple rule is best: “Don’t go beyond the data.” Every organization wants to claim “impact,” but not every evaluation can be based on the design and implementation.</p>
<div id="impact-evaluation" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Impact evaluation</h5>
<p>Revisiting the research taxonomy presented earlier, we see that there is overlap between evaluation (orange) and research (blue), a nod to Campbell’s view that program evaluation can be considered research in many cases. Furthermore, we see that something called “impact evaluation” is a subset of evaluation.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-17" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-17" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">A clinical trialist who works on Phase III studies is unlikely to refer to the trial as an “impact evaluation”, even though the randomized study design is a type of impact evaluation. This language is more commonly used by economists and others who study the impact of social sector programs and interventions. For instance, see the <a href="http://www.3ieimpact.org/">International Initiative for Impact Evaluation</a> (3ie) and the World Bank’s <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime">Development Impact Evaluation</a> (DIME) group.</span></span></p>

<span style="display: block;">What is impact evaluation? World Bank (2016). <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yyxbpxvd">https://tinyurl.com/yyxbpxvd</a></span></span></p>
<p>In an <strong>impact evaluation</strong>, the goal is to infer that some program—or some treatment, intervention, or policy—had an effect on some outcome. As we’ll discuss in later chapters, there are several research designs that will generate evidence of “impact”. One design in particular, the randomized controlled trial common to Phase II and III clinical trials, is an important type of impact evaluation. Not all impact evaluations are RCTs, but all RCTs are impact evaluations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="monitoring" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Monitoring</h4>
<p>Program monitoring is concerned with the implementation of programs, policies, or interventions. How are resources being used? Is the program being delivered as intended (or <em>with fidelity</em>)? How many people participate, and does the program reach the intended targets? These are all program-monitoring questions.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-19" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-19" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Bookmark these two terms. They will become very important when we talk about how to think about study results.</span></span></p>
<p>Accurate monitoring is essential for reporting data to funders, but it is also essential for all good evaluations. The reason is simple: If a program fails—that is, has no impact—the next question is why? Did the program fail because the idea or theory behind the program was wrong (<strong>theory failure</strong>)? Or was the implementation of the program so troubled that there was never a chance for success (i.e., <strong>implementation failure</strong>)? Every trial should include ongoing monitoring or a formal process evaluation to assess the impact of the program on a continual basis.</p>

<p>Academic centers around the world, like the <a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/">Duke Global Health Institute</a>, are major contributors to global health research. Public and private donors like the USG, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the World Bank make grants to university-affiliated faculty members who partner with colleagues inside and outside governments to plan and conduct research. Donors also channel research support to nonprofit research organizations such as <a href="https://www.fhi360.org/">FHI 360</a> and <a href="https://www.rti.org/">RTI International</a>, who work in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>Interesting hybrid models include the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL) and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). <a href="http://www.povertyactionlab.org/">JPAL</a> is a global network of university-affiliated professors from more than 50 universities that use randomized evaluations (i.e., experiments) to answer policy questions related to poverty alleviation. The JPAL website contains excellent resources regarding the methods used in randomized evaluations, as well as links to published studies and policy briefs. <a href="http://www.poverty-action.org/">IPA</a> is a sister organization that is also a leader in the use of randomized evaluations to study important policy questions about global poverty.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> The takeaway</h2>
<p>Research is defined as a systematic investigation whose goal is to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. As global health is the study and practice of improving health and achieving equity in health, <strong>global health research</strong> research includes all systematic efforts to create generalizable knowledge of how we can improve health and achieve equity in health for everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-23" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-23" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Usually when people speak of “the literature,” they mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing">scholarly</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review">peer-reviewed</a> journal articles. In addition, a body of work called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature">grey literature</a>” is more encompassing and harder to search systematically. Grey literature sources are typically disseminated through channels other than peer-reviewed journals. Examples include technical reports or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper">white papers</a> published on the web.</span></span></p>
<p>Given the complexity of our global health challenges, global health research is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. This means that, as a budding global health researcher, you will likely collaborate on teams with colleagues from many different fields. Each discipline has its own methodological preferences and core approaches, but we all operate in the same research landscape that is divided into basic and applied research. Much of the literature in global health focuses on our applied challenges, so you will read a lot about clinical research and trials, translational research, implementation research, and M&amp;E (monitoring and evaluation).</p>
<p>So no matter what discipline you call home, or what stage of research you find most interesting, you can make great contributions to our collective efforts to improve health and achieve equity in health.</p>
